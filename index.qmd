> *A practical guide to creating clear, effective maps in R with the **tmap** package.*

Welcome to the online home of **Spatial Data Visualization with tmap: A Practical Guide to Thematic Mapping in R**. 
This book is a hands-on, open-source resource for anyone interested in creating maps using R and the [**tmap**](https://github.com/r-tmap/tmap) package.

Whether you're a beginner in geospatial analysis or an experienced GIS user transitioning to R, this book will help you learn how to visualize spatial data for print, the web, and interactive applications.

## What you’ll learn {-}

This book walks you through the full process of thematic mapping with **tmap**, including:

- Load, explore, and prepare spatial data in R
- Build maps using **tmap**’s core components like shapes, layers, and visual variables
- Customize map appearance with legends, scales, layouts, and annotations
- Create faceted, animated, and interactive maps for various audiences
- Integrate **tmap** maps into reports, web apps, and Shiny dashboards
- Extend **tmap** by adding new map layer types, spatial data classes, and output modes
- Apply good design practices to make maps that are clear, consistent, and effective

Each chapter combines concise explanations, reproducible code, and real-world examples.
