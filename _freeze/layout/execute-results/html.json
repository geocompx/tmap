legends (@sec-legends), and map components (@sec-map-components).\nIt includes the map background, frame, typography, scale, aspect ratio, margins, and more.\n\nWe can customize the map layout using the `tm_layout()` function.\nIn this chapter, we cover the most often used arguments of this function using a map of Slovenia's regions as an example (@fig-layout-example).\n\n<!-- mention that is has tons of arguments -- we do not going to explain them all, but suggest to look at the help file, when needed -->\n<!-- maybe highlight that many layout arguments are valid for the plot mode only

colored -- it includes, among others, the map background, the outer space background, and the map legend background (@fig-layout-colors).\nThey can be customized with the `bg.color`, `outer.bg.color`, and `legend.bg.color` arguments of the `tm_layout()` function.\n<!-- more similar arguments exist -->\n<!-- why it is needed -->\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntm

to modify the complete map color style with arguments such as `color.saturation`, `color.sepia_intensity`, and `color_vision_deficiency_sim.`\nThe first one represents the saturation of all colors on the map, including the backgrounds, as well as visual variables such as the fill or color of polygons and lines.\nThe `color.saturation` parameter accepts a value between `0` and `1`, where `0` means no color saturation (i.e., the map is black and white), and `1` means full-color saturation (i.e., the map is colorful, default) (@fig-layout-saturation).\n<!-- why it is needed -->\n\n\n\n\n:::

`color.sepia_intensity` argument allows to apply a sepia filter to the map.\n<!-- explain -->\nIts value can be set between `0` and `1`, where `0` means no sepia filter (i.e., the map is colorful, default), and `1` means full sepia filter (i.e., the map is brownish) (@fig-layout-sepia).\n<!-- color.sepia_intensity, 0-1  -->\n<!-- default: 0 -->\n<!-- why it is needed -->\n\n\n\n\n:::

options aim to change the overall map look and feel.\nThe `color_vision_deficiency_sim` has a different purpose: it enables us to visualize how the map would appear to people with different color vision deficiencies.\nThree main types of color vision deficiencies are: *protanopia* (red-green color blindness, `\"protan\"`), *deuteranopia* (red-green color blindness, `\"deutan\"`), and *tritanopia* (blue-yellow color blindness, `\"tritan\"`).\n\n<!-- color_vision_deficiency_sim, -- better docs? possible options? -->\n<!-- why it is needed -->\n\n\n\n\n::: {#fig-layout-color-vision

possibility to change the map look is to customize the frame around the map content.\nIts style depends on several arguments of the `tm_layout()` function.\nFor example, `frame.color`, `frame.alpha`, and `frame.lwd` change the frame color, transparency (0-1), and line width, respectively (@fig-layout-frame-1).\n<!-- find a place in the book (or an appendix??) to explain what units are used for various elements, what do they mean, what are the ranges of values, etc. -->\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntm + \n  tm_layout(frame.color = \"black\",\n            frame.alpha = 0.6,\n            frame.lwd = 8)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nOther arguments that can be used to customize the frame are `frame.r` and `frame.double_line`  (@fig-layout-frame-2).\nThe first one makes the corners of the frame rounded -- the value of `0` means no rounding, while `30` means that the corners are rounded with a radius of 30.\n<!-- -- units? ranges of values? -->\n<!-- from 0 to 180? try 180 as a footnote? -->\n<!-- -- note that r can be specified to many other components< -->\nThe second one allows to add a second frame line around the frame.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntm + \n  tm_layout(frame.r = 30,\n            frame.double_line = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we can remove the frame completely by setting the `frame` argument to `FALSE` (@fig-layout-frame-3).\n<!-- explain when this is recommended or may be needed -->\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntm + \n

used fonts is often neglected when creating programmable plots and maps.\nMost often, the default fonts are used in these kinds of graphs.\nThis, however, could be a missed opportunity.\nA lot of map information is expressed by text, including text labels (@sec-text), legend labels, text in map components (@sec-map-components), or the map title (@sec-layout-elements).\nThe used fonts impact the tone of the map [@guidero_typography_2017], and their customization allows for a map to stand out from maps using default options.\n\n<!-- role of font faces and font families: -->\n<!-- - highlight different levels/importance -->\nAs we mentioned above, many different map elements can be expressed or can use fonts.\nIn theory, we are able to set different fonts to each of them.\nHowever, this could result in a confusing visual mix that would hinder our map information.\nTherefore, the decision on the used fonts should be taken after considering the main map message, expected map audience, other related graph styles, etc.\nIn the following three sections, we explain font families and font faces, and give some overall tips on font selections, show how to define used fonts, and how to customize fonts on maps.\n\n### Font families and faces {#sec-fonts}\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n::: {#fig-fonts .cell layout-ncol=\"2\" layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Font families](figures/fig-fonts-1.png){#fig-fonts-1 fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Font faces](figures/fig-fonts-2.png){#fig-fonts-2 fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n\nBasic font families, and font faces implemented in the tmap package.\n:::\n\n\n\n\nIn **tmap**, fonts are represented by a font family (@fig-fonts-1) and a font face (@fig-fonts-2).\nA font family is a collection of closely related lettering designs.\nExamples of font families include *Times*, *Helvetica*, *Courier*, *Palatino*, etc.\nOn the other hand, font faces, such as *italic* or *bold*, influence the orientation or width of the fonts.\nA *font* is, thus, a combination of a selected font family and font face.\n\nThere are a few general font families, such as serifs, sans serifs, and monospaced fonts.\nFonts from the serif family have small lines (known as *a serif*) attached to the end of some letters. \nNotice, for example, short horizontal lines on the bottom of letters *r*, *i*, and *f* or vertical lines at the ends of the letter *s* in the top row of @fig-fonts-1.\nThe fonts in this family are often viewed as more formal.\nOn the other hand, the sans serif family do not have serifs and is considered more informal and modern.\nThe last font family, monospaced fonts, is often used in computer programming (IDEs, software text editors), but less often on maps. \nA distinguishing feature of the monospaced fonts is that each letter or character in this family has the same width. \nTherefore, letters, such as *i* and *a* will occupy the same space in the monospaced fonts. \n<!-- explain what are font faces -->\n\nMixing the use of serif and sans serif fonts often works well for maps.\nHowever, a rule of thumb is not to mix more than two font families on one map.\nA sans serif font can be used to label cultural objects, while serif fonts to label physical features. \nThen, italics, for example, can be used to distinguish water areas.\nThe role of bold font faces, together with increased font size, is to highlight the hierarchy of labels -- larger, bold fonts indicate more prominent map features.\nAdditionally, customizing the fonts' colors can be helpful to distinguish different groups of map objects.\n<!-- cite - https://www.axismaps.com/guide/labeling -->\n\nThe decision on which fonts to use should also relates to the expected map look and feel. \nEach font family has a distinct personality (creates a \"semantic effect\"), which can affect how the map is perceived. \n<!-- references - https://gistbok.ucgis.org/bok-topics/typography -->\nSome fonts are more formal, some are less. \nSome fonts have a modern look, while others look more traditional.\n<!-- add examples -->\nAnother important concern is personal taste or map branding. \nWe should filter the decision about the used fonts based on our preferences or even our sense of beauty as it could create more personal and unique maps.\nWe just need to remember about the readability of the fonts -- they should not be too elaborate as it can hinder the main map message.\n\n<!-- suggested fonts or references??? -->\n\n### Fonts available in **tmap** {#sec-fonts-tmap}\n\nBefore we discuss how to set a font family and its face, it is important to highlight that a different set of fonts could exist for each operating system (and even each computer).\nAdditionally, which fonts are available and how they are supported depends on the used *graphic device*.\nA graphic device is a place where a plot or map is rendered.\nThe most commonly it is a some kind of a screen device, where we can see our plot or map directly after running the R code.\nOther graphic devices allow for saving plots or maps as files in various formats (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`, `.pdf`).\nTherefore, it is possible to get different fonts on your map on the screen, and a (slightly) different one when saved to a file.\nVisit `?Devices` or read the Graphic Devices chapter of @peng2016exploratory to learn more about graphic devices.\n\nThe **tmap** package has two mechanism to select a font family.\nThe first one is by specifying on of three general font families: `\"serif\"`, `\"sans\"`, or `\"monospace\"`.\nIt tries to match selected general font family with a font family existing on the operating system. \n<!-- https://github.com/r-lib/systemfonts#system-defaults -->\nFor example, `\"serif\"` could the `\"Times\"` font family, `\"sans\"` -- `\"Helvetica\"` or `\"Arial\"`, and `\"monospace\"` -- `\"Courier\"` (@fig-fonts-1).\nThe second mechanism allows to select a font family based on its name (e.g., `\"Times\"` or `\"Palatino\"`).\nNext, a member of the selected font families can be selected with one of the font faces: `\"plain\"`, `\"italic\"`, `\"bold\"`, and `\"bold.italic\"` (@fig-fonts-2).\n\n<!-- build-in fonts only -->\nAs mentioned before, available fonts depend on the computer setup (including operating system) and used graphic device. \nFonts available on the operating system can be checked with the `system_fonts()` function of the **systemfonts** package [@R-systemfonts] (result not shown).\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(systemfonts)\nsystem_fonts()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nInformation on installing and debugging custom fonts can be found in [a blog post](https://yjunechoe.github.io/posts/2021-06-24-setting-up-and-debugging-custom-fonts/) by June Choe and in the **showtext** package [@R-showtext] documentation.\n\nThe next step is to either view or save the map.\nThis also means that we need to carry over our fonts to the output window/file, which largely depends on the selected graphic device.\nIn general, screen device or graphical raster output formats, such as PNG, JPEG, or TIFF, works well with custom fonts as they rasterize them during saving.\nIn case of any problems with graphical raster outputs, it is possible to try alternative graphics devices implemented in the **ragg** package [@R-ragg].\nOn the other hand, graphical vector formats, such as PDF or SVG, could have some problems with saving maps containing custom fonts^[You can get the `invalid font type` error when saving the file.].\nThe PDF device in R, by default, adds metadata about the used fonts, but does not store them.\nWhen the PDF reader shows the document, it tries to locate the font on your computer, and use other fonts when the expected one does not exist.\nAn alternative approach is called embedding, which adds a copy of each necessary font to the PDF file itself.\nGladly, the creation of a PDF with proper fonts can be achieved in a few ways.\nFirstly, it could be worth trying some alternative graphic devices such as `cairo_pdf` or `svglite::svglite`.\nThe second option is to use the **showtext** package [@R-showtext], which converts text into color-filled polygonal outlines for graphical vector formats.\n<!-- footnote: if/when the device argument is added to tmap_save, then mention saving to ragg/cairo_pdf -->\nThirdly, the **extrafont** [@R-extrafont] package allows embedding the fonts in the PDF file, which makes PDFs properly displayed on computers that do not have the given font.\n<!-- ref to map_save!! -->\n\n### Fonts on maps {#sec-fonts-on-maps}\n\n<!-- explain defaults -->\nBy default, **tmap** uses the `\"sans\"` font family with the `\"plain\"` font face (@fig-fonts). \nThere are, however, three ways to customize the used fonts.\nThe first one is to change all of the fonts and font faces for the whole map at once (@fig-mfonts-1).\nThis can be done with the `text.fontfamily` and `text.fontface` arguments of `tm_layout()`.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntm +\n    tm_layout(\n        text.fontface = \"italic\",\n        text.fontfamily = \"serif\"\n    )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe second way is to specify just some text elements independently (@fig-mfonts-2).\nMany **tmap** functions, such as `tm_text()` or `tm_credits()`, have their own `fontfamily` and `fontface` arguments that can be adjusted.\nAdditionally, `tm_layout()` allows to customize fonts for other map elements using prefixed arguments, such as, `title.fontface` or `legend.title.fontfamily`.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntm +\n    tm_layout(\n        title.fontface = \"bold.italic\",\n        legend.title.fontfamily = \"monospace\"\n    )\n```\n:::\n\n::: {#fig-mfonts .cell layout-nrow=\"2\" layout-align=\"center\"}\n:::

{.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n<!-- font sizes customization? -->\n\n<!-- ## Legend {#sec-llegend} -->\n\n## Scale {#sec-scale}\n\nThe **tmap** package has a set of default sizes and widths for various map elements, such as the frame, text, borders, symbol sizes, and more.\nIn the previous parts of this book, we modify some of these values for selected elements, such as the frame width or text size.\nAt the same time, we can also change the size of all of the map elements at once -- this is a role of the `scale` argument of the `tm_layout()` function.\n<!-- It accepts a numeric value, where `1` means the default sizes and widths, `0.5` means that all of the map elements are half as large as the default ones, and `1.5` means that all of the map elements are 1.5 times larger than the default ones. -->\n<!-- Martijn: is the above statement correct? -->\n\n\n\n\n::: {#fig-layout-scale .cell layout-ncol=\"2\" layout-align=\"center\"}\n:::

credits or a title), and the legend, which are often located in different places.\nThey also have numerous margins -- spaces between data and the frame, spaces between the frame and the plotting, spaces between the icons and the labels, etc.\n\nMany of these properties can be customized, however, it may be difficult to understand the effect of the changes.\n<!-- ... -->\nTo make it easier, **tmap** has a design mode that can be turned on by setting the `tmap_design_mode()` function to `TRUE`.\nWhen the design mode is turned on, the map is displayed in a special way: it shows all of the created map content, but also adds various lines and colored areas to the map.\nWe may see an example of a map in the design mode in @fig-design-mode:\n\n<!-- - explain colors -->\n<!-- - as a list -->\n\nAdditionally, it returns a small table in the R console with sizes and an aspect ratio of the device, plot, facets, and map areas.\n<!-- explain these areas? -->\n\nThe design mode is useful to understand how the map is constructed and how the various arguments of the `tm_layout()` function impact the map layout.\n\n<!-- info that this is limited to the plot mode? -->\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell

`FALSE`.\nIn the next few sections, we will show how the design mode can help us to understand the impact of various arguments of the `tm_layout()` function on the aspect ratio and margins of the map.\n\n## Aspect ratio {#sec-aspect}\n\n<!-- Aspect ratio of each map. When asp is set to NA (default) the aspect ratio will be adjusted to the used shapes. When set to 0 the aspect ratio is adjusted to the size of the device divided by the number of columns and rows. -->\n\nThe aspect ratio specifies the relation between the width and height of the map area of the plot.\nFor statistical plots, aspect ratios usually adjust to the plotting space -- thus, customization of an aspect ratio is usually not needed.\nFor maps, this is not the case -- we should not change the relation between the width and height of the data in a map as it has a specific projection that determines the spatial relation between the map features.\n\nBy default, the aspect ratio of the *tmap* is set to `NA`, which means that it is adjusted to the used shapes (@fig-layout-example).\n<!--Martijn, please explain the rest of the aspect values in the code/map below -- I do not know what they exactly mean. -->\n\n\n\n\n::: {#fig-layout-asp .cell layout-nrow=\"2\" layout-ncol=\"2\" layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![`asp = 0`](figures/fig-layout-asp-1.png){#fig-layout-asp-1 fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![`asp = 0.5`](figures/fig-layout-asp-2.png){#fig-layout-asp-2 fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![`asp = 1`](figures/fig-layout-asp-3.png){#fig-layout-asp-3 fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![`asp = 2`](figures/fig-layout-asp-4.png){#fig-layout-asp-4 fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n\nImpact of the aspect ratio on the map layout.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Margins {#sec-lmargins}\n\nMargins are spaces around the map content, which can be used to separate the map from other elements, such as the legend or the title or separate the map from the extent of the plotting area.\nThey may serve various purposes, such as to make the map more readable, to avoid overlapping the map content with other elements, to create space for additional elements.\nOn the other hand, making margins smaller can help to increase the map area or make the map more condensed.\n\nThere are several arguments in `tm_layout()` related to margins.\nAll of the margin arguments can be customized either with a single value (which is then applied to all sides) or with a vector of four values, which represent the bottom, left, top, and right margins.\n<!-- units?

-->\n\n<!-- inner.margins, -->\nThe inner margins are spaces between the map content (e.g., symbols, lines, polygons, raster) and the frame of the map (@fig-inner-margins).\nBy default, the inner margins are set to `c(0.02, 0.02, 0.02, 0.02)`, which means that there is a 2% margin on each side of the map content (@fig-layout-example).\nAn exception to this rule is raster maps, where the inner margins are set to `c(0, 0, 0, 0)` -- meaning that there are no margins around the raster map content -- by default.\nIncreasing the inner margins can help to avoid overlapping of the map content with other elements, such as the legend or the title -- for example, we could add some margin on the right side of the map and then place the legend there.\n<!-- mention defaults! -->\n<!-- inner.margins.extra -- ????
